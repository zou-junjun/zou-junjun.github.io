This paper presents the design and implementation of an auto-tuning continuous-time bandpass sigma-delta (ΣΔ) modulator for micro-electromechchanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope readout systems. Its notch frequency can well match the input signal frequency by adding a signal observation to the traditional ΣΔ modulator. The filter of the observation adopts the same architecture as that of the traditional ΣΔ modulator, allowing the two filters to have the same response to input signal change, which is converted into a control voltage on metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) resistance in the filters. The automatic tuning not only works to solve the mismatch problem caused by process error and temperature variation, but can also be applied to the interface circuit of gyroscopes with different resonant frequencies. The circuit is implemented in a 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process with a core area of 2.4 mm2. The improved modulator achieves a dynamic range of 106 dB, a noise floor below 120 dB and a maximum signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 86.4 dB. The tuning capability of the chip is relatively stable under input signals from 6 to 15 kHz at temperatures ranging from −45 to 60 °C.[(PDF)](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)
