_2021 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), (2021)_ [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9401631](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9401631)

This paper proposed an ultra-low noise bandgap reference (BGR), which could achieve a sub-microvolt level of peak-to peak output noise in the low frequency region and have good load capacity. The noise performance is improved by using a negative feedback loop rather than traditional operational amplifier, which eliminates the noise from operational amplifier. Additionally, detailed analysis of noise is used to optimize the noise performance of the BGR. The driving ability is improved by using current mirrors to avoid the effect of load current on the behavior of BGR. Simulation results show operating at a 5 V supply voltage, over the range from -40 째C to 125 째C, output voltage of the BGR is 1.3345 V of mean value and temperature coefficient is 13.07 ppm/째C. The peak-to-peak output noise of the BGR is 442.1 nV in the band of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. The maximum output load current is 444.6 mA. MonteCarlo simulation illustrates process-invariance of this design.
