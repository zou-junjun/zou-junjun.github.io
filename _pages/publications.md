<u>**[2] A 442.1 nVpp, 13.07 ppm/°C Ultra-Low Noise Bandgap Reference Circuit in 180 nm BCD Process**</u>

by **JunJun Zou**, Qi Wei, Bin Zhou, Xiang Li, Chunge Ju, Rong Zhang, Zhiyong Chen

_2021 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), (2021)_ [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9401631](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9401631)

**Abstract:** This paper proposed an ultra-low noise bandgap reference (BGR), which could achieve a sub-microvolt level of peak-to peak output noise in the low frequency region and have good load capacity. The noise performance is improved by using a negative feedback loop rather than traditional operational amplifier, which eliminates the noise from operational amplifier. Additionally, detailed analysis of noise is used to optimize the noise performance of the BGR. The driving ability is improved by using current mirrors to avoid the effect of load current on the behavior of BGR. Simulation results show operating at a 5 V supply voltage, over the range from -40 °C to 125 °C, output voltage of the BGR is 1.3345 V of mean value and temperature coefficient is 13.07 ppm/°C. The peak-to-peak output noise of the BGR is 442.1 nV in the band of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. The maximum output load current is 444.6 mA. MonteCarlo simulation illustrates process-invariance of this design.


 **[3] An Auto-Tuning Continuous-Time Bandpass Sigma-Delta Modulator with Signal Observation for MEMS Gyroscope Readout Systems**

_Sensors 2020, 20(7);_ [https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/7/1973]( https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/7/1973)

**Abstract:** This paper presents the design and implementation of an auto-tuning continuous-time bandpass sigma-delta (ΣΔ) modulator for micro-electromechchanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope readout systems. Its notch frequency can well match the input signal frequency by adding a signal observation to the traditional ΣΔ modulator. The filter of the observation adopts the same architecture as that of the traditional ΣΔ modulator, allowing the two filters to have the same response to input signal change, which is converted into a control voltage on metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) resistance in the filters. The automatic tuning not only works to solve the mismatch problem caused by process error and temperature variation, but can also be applied to the interface circuit of gyroscopes with different resonant frequencies. The circuit is implemented in a 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process with a core area of 2.4 mm2. The improved modulator achieves a dynamic range of 106 dB, a noise floor below 120 dB and a maximum signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 86.4 dB. The tuning capability of the chip is relatively stable under input signals from 6 to 15 kHz at temperatures ranging from −45 to 60 °C.[(PDF)](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)
