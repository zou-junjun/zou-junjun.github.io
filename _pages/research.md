Research Experience
------
**2020.08-2022.06 A study on high-precision bandgap reference circuit, Tsinghua University**
* Advisor: Prof Wei Qi
* Analyze the main noise resource and noise transfer function of traditional bandgap reference (BGR)
* Propose a novel BGR topology by removing the error amplifier in the traditional BGR
* Present a simplified but accurate noise model of proposed BGR to optimize output noise performance
* Utilize the temperature characteristic of the current gain factor β to accomplish high-order temperature compensation
* **Tape-out in 180 nm BCD process**
* Simulation and chip tests verify low output noise and low output temperature variation of proposed BGR

**2019.09-2020.06 A study on an auto-tuning continuous-time bandpass sigma-delta modulator, Tsinghua University**
* Advisor: Prof Wei Qi
* Propose a continuous-time SDM with a 3-bit flash ADC and a second-order loop filter, which is composed of cascaded 2-stage RC integrator. And resistors in the loop filter are voltage-controlled MOS resistors.
* Propose a pseudo-PLL circuit to alleviate the difference between input signal’s frequency and notch frequency of SDM. The pseudo-PLL circuit can trace input signal’s frequency and output a control voltage to modulate the notch frequency of the loop filter.
* **Tape-out in 180 nm CMOS process**
* Simulation and chip tests verify the SNDR performance of proposed sigma-delta modulator
